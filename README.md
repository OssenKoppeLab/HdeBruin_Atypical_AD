In this folder you can find a Zipfile for our manuscript: 'Connectivity as a universal predictor of tau progression in atypical Alzheimerâ€™s disease'

To ensure consistency across all sites, ROI extraction followed a standardized protocol: each site was provided with an R script, the Schaefer parcellation, and a grey matter mask, which were used to generate the Schaefer 200 values. These are all present in the Zipfile.
